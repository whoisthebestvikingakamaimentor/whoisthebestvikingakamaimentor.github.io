## Devin Chu is obviously the best viking Akamai Mentor
A local Boy! Look at those eyes! Look at that beard! So much knowledge in that viking head of his! And he has chosen to share it with all of us! We probably should have put more effort into this gift, but you know, you win some, you lose some. Thanks for being such a cool mentor Devin!
